    <h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
    <h4>FILLING</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a microwave safe bowl, add the filtered water and frozen peas and
        microwave for 1-2 minutes or until the peas are soft and fully cooked.
        It's best to follow the instructions on your package too.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large pan over medium heat, add the vegetable oil and onions. Saute
        for one minute or until the onions are slightly translucent. Add the
        garlic and saute for 30 seconds or until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground beef and cook until the meat is brown, this is about 2-5
        minutes. The meat will continue to cook in the sauce, but if you are
        hesitant about food safety, the meat temperature should be around 160
        °F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add tomato sauce, sugar, salt, and pepper into the pan and stir until
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add carrots and potatoes and cook for about 10-12 minutes or until
        potatoes are soft enough to pierce with a fork without resistance, but
        not disintegrating.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the peas and cook for an additional 1 minute to warm up the peas
      </li>
      <li>
        Sauce should be thick and chunky. Move the pan from the heat and leave
        it to cool until you are ready to assemble. You want this to be cool to
        the touch so you don't end up melting your dough while you are filling
        it with meat and trying to assemble your empanadas. If you are cooking
        this ahead of time, transfer the filling into an airtight container once
        it's cooled and move it into the fridge.

    <h4>DOUGH</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk all the dry ingredients into a mixing bowl and then add the cold butter. Use a pastry cutter to mix the butter into dry ingredients. Stop when the butter is about the size of a pea. Alternatively, do this in your food processor.</li>

      <li>In a small bowl, beat the egg and whisk in the water.</li>
      <li>Add the wet ingredients into the large mixing bowl with the dry ingredients and butter. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to combine. Use your hands to form the dough into a ball and wrap with cling wrap.</li>

      <li>Remove: the circle of dough from the parchment paper and place it at the palm of your hand.</li>

      <img src="Artboard 8.png" alt="Beef 8" width="500" height="500"/>
      <li>Seal: Take one end of the dough and fold it over so that the log is nestled in between. Use your hands to press the edges together.</li>
      <img src="Artboard 9.jpg" alt="Beef 9" width="500" height="500"/>
      <li>Crimp: Use a fork to crimp and finish the edges. Place the finished empanada on a parchment paper lined sheet pan.</li>

      <li>Repeat with all balls of dough.</li>
      <li>Beat an egg and brush each empanada on top. Place empanadas in the middle rack of your oven and bake for 25-30 minutes per batch.</li>
